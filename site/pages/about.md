            This is a kind-of autobiographical retelling of the development of LSD: Revamped. Each step is accompanied
            by a picture of the state of the game at the time.

            The project started in October 2011 because I wanted to work on something and
            I had been watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/azuritereaction" target="_blank">AzuriteReaction</a>
            play LSD: Dream Emulator. I didn't know
            much about game development at that point, and I knew nothing about Unity, the
            engine that LSD Revamped runs on. At this point the game was called 'LSD: The Remake'.

            The project's vision was initially to be a HD, modern version of LSD. I was attempting to make
            HD versions of all the environments, and teaching myself programming and art along the way.

            By December 2012, the game had a title screen. Not pictured here is the mountain of janky code
            the whole game was built upon. It wasn't very stable at all, was slow, and would frequently crash.
            You used to be able to use JavaScript in Unity, and a lot of the game's code was written in this.

            By 2013 I had discovered C# (another language Unity supported) and decided it was better (it was).
            I began rewriting large portions of the game's code in C#. This would be the second rewrite out of three.
            The code was still kinda janky, but not Unity JavaScript janky.

            I added a counter for when development started to the title screen. I used the wrong date.
            The actual value should be 664 days. If only I knew I'd still be doing it at 3113 days (at time

            To provide some context, when I started in 2011 I was about 14 years old and attending
            school full time. I was now 16 years old, and still attending school full time. It was
            difficult to find time to work on the game, but I definitely wasn't doing it as much as
            I should have. So I decided to set myself a goal to finish it that year! The name also
            changed to 'LSD Revamped', which it would keep. I think the goal here was to make it
            more explicit that the game was going to be more modern and not just a remake. I ended
            up making it look retro anyway, oh well.

            On the 21st December, 2014, the game releases to everyone. It was still far from finished. I had one
            of the busiest days of my life responding to questions, fixing bugs/crashes from reports, and reading
            feedback. It was amazing. A week after the release, Osamu Sato (the original creator of LSD: Dream
            Emulator) would post a link to it on his Facebook page. I don't find this out until 2016, but when I do

            It's the summer. I've finished school, and I have nothing but free time before starting

            At home from University on Christmas break, I decide to try to reverse engineer some
            of the original game's files based on some tips I got from a fan, 'elzo_d'.
            I ended up being able to extract the tiles that make up the game world. I couldn't
            figure out how the textures were stored, so I settled for texturing them manually.
            This would be the start of a series of reverse engineering breakthroughs that allowed
            me to load complete levels right from the files of the original game.

            I'm now extracting tiles from the original game, deduplicating them (they were split across
            multiple files, with some tiles being in many), manually texturing them, using a Blender
            script to load them into Blender and arrange them in the layout of the level, exporting them
            to OBJ, importing them to Torii, then exporting them to be loaded as levels in game. Phew.
            Don't worry, it gets easier than this as I make more reverse engineering progress.
