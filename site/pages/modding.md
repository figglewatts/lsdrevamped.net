## Modding tools

The SDK (Software Development Kit) gives you the ability to make mods for LSD:R using the Unity editor. The SDK itself comes as a Unity package, allowing you to create your mod as a Unity project, using the tools to export it to be loaded into the game.

It has been built around Unity 2021.3, it may work in future versions of Unity too but I havenâ€™t tested that.

### Features

- Create your own dreams.
- Add anything to them that Unity supports (except custom C# scripts).
- Customise behaviour with Lua scripting.
- Control the dream graph.
- Create flashback events.
- Create video and text dreams.
- Add your own music and sound effects.

### Get the tools
