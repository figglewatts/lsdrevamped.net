The mod tools for LSD: Revamped are currently still in development.

When they're done, you'll be able to:

- Create custom dreams
- Use custom models
- Play your own music
- Import your own textures

The mod tools will be available as a Unity Editor plugin, you will be able to create
dreams with whichever tools are compatible with Unity and distribute them as prefabs
in asset bundles playable in-game via the LSD: Revamped SDK.

All content currently seen in-game is produced using the LSD: Revamped SDK, so it can
already be used to create awesome interactive experiences!

What I am working on now is polishing the SDK to make it easier for other people to use.
This involves writing a lot of documentation and producing a handful of tutorials. It also
involves creating the tooling used to generate and host the documentation online.

So, sit tight! They'll be ready in the next version - 0.3!
